This is for ITSC 3155.

Please try to get this so your localhost displays the "hello" in the browser from the PHP file.

Ignore the index.php files. Most of them do do anything, they just serve as a temporary file location.

Files are organized like so:
application -> models
            -> views
            -> controllers
config
core
db
lib
public -> css
       -> js
scripts -> java -> out
                -> src
                
Micheal: right now only be concerned about the: config, scripts -> java directories.
         The config will be where all of our programs will be looking at for local database info.
         
Bryan: right now only be concerned about the: config, application -> views, public -> css, 
       public -> js directories. The view directory is what you will be putting your php html code
       The css directory is where you will put the css files.
